# LeagueBuilds
Collects match and build data from most recent League of Legends matches in the Challenger division

A work in progress.  The idea is to eventually create an android application that displays the items and other build info
used by the ~1600 challenger-ranked summoners across the eight game regions.  This way, newer players can see what items pros are using 
and can more successfully strategize against their lane partners.
